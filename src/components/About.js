        <p>
          Welcome to Cozy Coffee! We’re more than just a coffee shop — we’re a
          community built around warmth, flavor, and connection.

          Our beans are hand-selected from the finest farms and roasted to
          perfection to bring out their full aroma. Whether you’re here for a
          latte or a place to work in peace, we’ve got you covered.
